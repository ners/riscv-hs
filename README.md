# RISCV-HS

A logical model of a minimal RISC-V CPU written in Haskell.

This is an exercise to learn Nix, Haskell, and RISC-V.
It is not intended to be useful, fast, or even complete.

The goal is to understand the inner workings of the RISC-V architecture from the bottom-up and learn Haskell concepts on the way.
A possible outcome would be an emulator that can run RV32I assembly.

# Requirements

- Install Nix
  - follow instructions on https://nixos.org/download
- Enable flakes
  - follow instructions on https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes
- (Optional) install [`direnv`](https://direnv.net)

# Project structure
- The structure of the project is dictated by the tools we are using, namely Nix and Cabal. This repository is both a Nix flake and a Cabal package and as such contains the following folders/files:
  - app/
    - Main.hs: Haskell source for an executable that is built and run by 'cabal run'. It does not do anything meaningful at the moment.
  - src/
    - Bits.hs: Haskell library that provides the 'Bits' module.
  - test/
    - Main.hs: Haskell source for an executable that is built and run by 'cabal test', used to test the functions defined in 'src/Bits.hs'
  - CHANGELOG.md: This file will only become relevant in case of a release.
  - flake.nix : This is a [Nix flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) providing dependencies for the project, namely GHC and Cabal, for Linux and MacOS/Darwin on x86_64.
  - flake.lock: File automatically created by Nix that does not need to be touched.
  - LICENSE: The Apache 2.0 license.
  - riscvs-hs.cabal: Cabal [package description](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.4/cabal-package.html)
